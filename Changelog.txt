Changes June 2014 by D-NXKT:

- fix for possible wing failure at startup
- screen message with state of toggle "wing failure" and "auto-coordination"


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes January 2014 by D-NXKT:

- aerotowing is now compatible with yasim-draggers
  (tow-forces are transmitted by multiplayer) 
- exact winch/towing rope animations
- enable-hot = FALSE for winch/towing rope 
  (prevents unrealistic wing failure, if fuselage contact point hits rope) 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes July 2013 by D-NXKT:

- accurate speed polar for flap positions 1-4
- good stall characteristic
- tailspin
- weight and balance
- rain impact on performance
- ground effect
- wing failure
- improved wing bending (aerodynamic and structural loads) 
- accurate control surface deflections
- side-string
- improved cockpit
- animated wing view
- additional sounds
- checklists
- fuselage length (rear part) adjusted
- few improvements for winch and towing but still experimental


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes January 2013 by D-NXKT:

- fdm converted from UIUC to JSBSim
- add speedbrakes (model)
- add flaps (model + fdm)
- add gear (fdm)
- add water ballast ( rough animation + fdm)
- animate modell including (rough) wing deflection
- add necessary instruments (quick and dirty copy paste from 
  already existing instruments)
- include experimental winch, towing, drag-robot functionality 
  from DG101G (Nikolaus Kerner) without modifications   
  
- make JSBSim-Version the default (asw20-set.xml)
- enable multiplayer (incl. wing deflection and water dumping)
- add splash.png


Note: 
- all aero-coefficients from UIUC adopted (except flaps)
- rough assumptions for missing aero-coefficients 
  (gear drag, flap lift+drag, speedbrake lift)
- glider flight performance not yet checked! However UIUC-part seems reasonable.
- outstanding calibration with origin glider performance data
_ model: span is 16m (original 15m); fuselage length ca. 1m shorter 
  compared to real plane
- it is highly appreciated if someone else wants to improve the cockpit!
