Hi Roland,

<...snip...>

To include the model w/ FGFS, it would be included under the GNU GPL.
I assume you do know what this is.

So again, is it OK if I move forward w/ this?  Your model and the aero
behind it are really great w/ FGFS!

Thanks,
Michael

Dear Michael,

<...snip...> 

So for me there is no problem at all; you have my permission to
use the ASW 20 as long as you credit me.

Best regards
